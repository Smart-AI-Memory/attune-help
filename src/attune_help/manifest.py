"""Feature manifest parser with project-doc field support.

Loads .help/features.yaml, validates structure, and exposes the
Feature model extended with doc_kinds/doc_paths/arch_path fields
for project-level documentation tracking. Also parses the
top-level ``_docs:`` bucket for hand-written narrative docs that
don't belong to any single feature (FAQ, glossary, installation,
etc.).

Backward compatibility: legacy ``doc_path`` (scalar) is accepted
on load and migrated into ``doc_paths`` (list). Saved manifests
always emit ``doc_paths``.

This module is intentionally self-contained so attune-author can
import from here rather than carrying its own copy.
